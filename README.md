# High Low

Implementation of a House vs Players High Low game. Very similar to [this implementation](https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/higher-or-lower.html)

## Getting started

```
((git clone))
npm install
truffle compile
truffle migrate --reset
truffle test
```
Note that all the commands assume here you have ganache running.

### If you wish to use truffle console
```
truffle console
> var hl = await contractname.deployed()
((( do whatever )))
```
